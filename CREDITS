The development of this MVA algorithm would have not been possible without the many open source information, files and works that people are willing to share.
This is the main reason why I am 'giving back' what I have learned, and I hope this small project will help many others.

The sources I have used include, but are not limited to:
  
  https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2013/04/01/minimum-variance-algorithm-mva/
  http://www.systematicportfolio.com/minvar
  
I have also used some or all of the related material that can be found inside those links and sources.

Another big thanks goes to the QuantConnect and Quantopian communities, which are an amazing source of inspiration.
