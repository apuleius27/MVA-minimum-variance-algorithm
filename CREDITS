The development of this MVA algorithm would have not been possible without the many open source information, files and works that I have found online.
This is the main reason why I am 'giving back' what I have learned.

The sources I have used include, but are not limited to:
  
  https://www.quantconnect.com/tutorials/introduction-to-financial-python/modern-portfolio-theory
  https://www.quantopian.com/posts/adaptive-asset-allocation-algorithms
  https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2013/04/01/minimum-variance-algorithm-mva/
  http://www.systematicportfolio.com/minvar
  


I have also used some or all of the related material that can be found inside those links and sources.
